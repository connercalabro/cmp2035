			<h3>skills </h3>

	
			<p> 
			Over the years I have definitely acquired a wide skill-set that spans across the arts (both digital and fine) as well as interpersonal communication. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I've been doing fine arts since I was in high school and have gotten extremely comfortable and confident using various mediums for drawing and painting including oil paint, water color, mixed media, charcoal, pencil, and collage. I have also done pottery and know how to use a wheel although I wouldn't say it's my expertise. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The digital hard skills I have acquired have been cultivated through the graphic desing courses I've taken in college. I consider myself and expert in a few of Adobe Creative Suite's programs including Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign. Additionally, I have used Microsoft Powerpoint and Keynote to make presentations visually appealing as well. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Finally I believe I have powerful interpersonal communication skills that have been strengthened by the diverse group of people I've met and had to interact with on a diverse campus. Furthermore, my public speaking skills have been seasoned through many speeches I've made on behalf of organizations I am a part of at Tufts.
