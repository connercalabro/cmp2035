			<h3>who i am </h3>

	
			<p> 
			I was born in Japan, but grew up in Mill Valley, California. My mom is from Tokyo and my dad is also Japanese, but he grew up in LA and is 4th generation American. Growiing up I spoke Japanese with my mom at home and English my dad. I went to a public school in San Francisco where I’m from and also attended Japanese’s school every Saturday. Going to Japanese school every Saturday made it so that if we ever moved back to Japan I could fully integrate back into the Japanese school system. 
			<br> 
			<br>
			My mom is from Tokyo and she went to arts school and worked in design. Because I’m an only child, growing up she kept me occupied with art and engrained it in my soul at a young age. 
			<br> 
			<br>
			Another huge influencer on my life and who I am today is the town I grew up in. Mill Valley is the place I call home. It’s 15 minutes outside of San Francisco—one of the first cities after you cross the bridge. It has the bay, the mountains, and is surrounded by red woods natures. Consequently, growing up I spend a lot of time outdoors and in nature.
