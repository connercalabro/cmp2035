			<h3>education </h3>

	
			<p> 
			My college experience has been an absolutel rollercoaster ride. I have been exposed to more topics, people, and ideas than I could've ever imagined and they've all shaped who I am as both a student, a professional, and a person. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I came in having no idea what I wanted to study and luckily enough at a liberal arts school I had the opportunity to take every introduction class under the sun. I went through many changes in direction--at one point I was pre-med and another point I was an International Relations and then landed on a Japanese major with a Studio Art Minor. My assortment of classes has helped me to become a well-rounded student, a flexible learner, and an informed young woman. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Outside of academics I'm hevaily involved with the Japanse Culture Club (JCC). We meet weekly to have open discussions as well as put on events to help increase awareness about Japanese Culture. I've also been a member of the Varsity Women's Tennis team at Tufts for all my 4 years where I've balanced to manage a full course load, 12-15 hours of practice a week, as well as team bonding activities and coordination.
