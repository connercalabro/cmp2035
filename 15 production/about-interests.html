			<h3>interests </h3>

	
			<p> 
			First and foremost I am interested in and passionate about my Japanese Hertiage. Although I've always been aware of Japanese culture because of my mom, it wasn't until after I took a course in college, 'Race in America' that helped me understand my Asian identity and further developed my interest in the topic. When I studied abroad in Japan, it opened my eyes to a whole world I have the potential to be a part of and only deepened my connection and desire to explore Japanese culture both past and present. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Another passion of mine is taking a stance for social movements. I realize that although in some ways I am marginalized, in many ways I also hold a place of privaledge. I want to put my energy and my body in places that help to deconstruct deeply engrained systems I find problematic and detrimental to our world. 
			<br>
			<br>
			And finally, I have also been passionate about healthy living and wellness. Growing up surrounded by so much nature I often found it meditative and hav since picked up yoga. Nature, meditation, healthy eating, and fitness help to keep my life balanced and also help me feeling the way I strive to.
